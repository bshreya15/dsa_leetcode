You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
